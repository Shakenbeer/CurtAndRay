Curt and Ray are playing a game. Ray sets and hides mines. Curt plays a role of minesweeper. But he doesn't want to find mines rather he wants to avoid mines. Help Curt to reach his goal by building safe path.
Also you can try to rescue mini-Curts, but this is not necessarily.
Don't forget to read "how to".
Easy and fun game for children and real challenge on latest levels.
